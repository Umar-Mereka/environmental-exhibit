# Naming Standards

- Screen - ExampleScreen, MyFirstExampleScreen, etc.
    - Each environment should be classified as 'Levels' internally. Environment: City should then be named Level1 for example. Subsequent levels should be named Level2, Level3, etc.
- Event Sheets - ES_ES *(ExampleScreen_EventSheet but y'know, shortened)*, MFES_ES, etc
- Objects - All object types must adhere to the same naming convention, which is objecttype_identifier. Detailed examples can be found below:
    - Text - text_char_select, text_timer, etc.
    - button - button_menu, button_ exit, etc.
- Audio - Audio files must identify what purpose that they use ie bgm_level1 identifies that it is a background music file for level 1
- Any kind of music or even a jingle should be placed under the 'Music' folder whilst any kind of sounds should be placed under the 'Sounds' folder. Music should be melodious and non-diegetic *(like the sound doesn't come from the "real-world" of the game)* like background music and those little victory jingles that you get in video games. Sounds that are more diegetic *(Realistic sounds from the "real-world" of the game)* like background ambient noises and button clicks.
- Fonts - Fonts should be left alone they're fonts who cares
- Videos - name_screen ie. intro_level1.mp4
- Timelines - KIV
- Families - KIV
